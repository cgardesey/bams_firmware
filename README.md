## Software Setup
1. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port from the **Tools** menu.
4. Create a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
5. Copy and paste the code from the `Smart_Security.ino` file into your sketch.
6. Save the sketch with a meaningful name.

## Usage
1. Upload the **bams_firmware.ino** sketch to the Arduino board by clicking the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.
2. The LED connected to the Arduino board should start blinking at a fixed interval.
3. Experiment with the code to and customize to suit your needs.
